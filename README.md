# About

Yarrtube is a self-hosted service that watches tracked Youtube playlists and channels and automatically downloads the new videos published.

Yarrtube is mainly thought to be installed on your NAS via Docker with the rest of your media stack (Plex, Jellyfin, etc.) but it can also be installed on any laptop.

# Motivation

This is a personal project. I'm a software engineer coming back from a ~10-month sabbatical, and I wanted a real, finished thing to get my hands dirty again, both with writing code and with AI-assisted coding.

It also solves an actual problem at home: I wanted a reliable, ad-free way to watch specific channels and playlists in Plex, especially for my kids. Yarrtube keeps the playlists and channels I care about mirrored to disk with media-server-friendly naming, so they just show up in Plex. **No ads and no algorithm**.

It doesn't aim to compete with anything. If you want a full-featured archiver, projects like [TubeArchivist](https://www.tubearchivist.com/) do far more. Yarrtube is small on purpose.

# Main Features

- Track Youtube public playlists.
- Track entire channels and download new videos when they are published!
- Minimalistic webapp to see the videos from the browser in both desktop and mobile.
- Basic support for Plex, Kodi and Jellyfin.
- **Coming soon** extended support for Plex Collections.
