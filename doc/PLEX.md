# Plex integration notes

## What you get

Without the integration, a Plex library over yarrtube's videos is a flat
grid of every downloaded video. With it, yarrtube keeps **one Plex
collection per tracked playlist and channel**: the library becomes one tile
per playlist/channel, videos inside keep their playlist order (publish
order for channels), and autoplay carries you from one video to the next.

Everything below is a one-time setup. Once configured, yarrtube converges
the collections automatically in the background (every 15 minutes by
default): new downloads are added once Plex has scanned them, videos that
leave yarrtube's state are removed, and deleting a playlist/channel in
yarrtube deletes its collection in Plex.

## 1. Give Plex access to yarrtube's videos

Plex and yarrtube must both see the downloaded files:

- Mount the same host folder into both containers — e.g. the folder mounted
  at `/videos` in yarrtube also mounted (read-only is fine) into Plex.
- The mount paths **don't** have to match: yarrtube matches its videos to
  Plex items by YouTube video ID, never by file path.

Create a **Movies**-type library in Plex pointing at that folder (a
dedicated library just for yarrtube content works best — you probably don't
want YouTube videos mixed into your movie library, and the recommended
settings below are per-library).

## 2. Make Plex read yarrtube's metadata files

Next to every video, yarrtube writes a `movie.nfo` file carrying the video's
title, a position-prefixed sort title, and the YouTube video ID
(`<uniqueid type="youtube">...</uniqueid>`). Plex must ingest these NFO
files — they are what gives every item:

- a `youtube://<video-id>` GUID, which is **how the sync recognizes a
  video** (no NFO ingestion → no GUID → the video never joins a collection);
- the sort title that keeps collections in playlist order.

In the library's settings (Manage Library → Edit → Advanced), configure the
agent/scanner to use local metadata: enable **"Use local assets"** and
prefer local metadata over online agents so the NFO wins.
<!-- TODO(sergi): confirm the exact agent/setting names of your working
     setup here — this is the part that varies most between Plex versions. -->

**Verify it worked** before going further: in the Plex web app open any
yarrtube-downloaded video → `⋯` → *Get Info* → *View XML*. You should see
a line like:

```xml
<Guid id="youtube://dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
```

If there is no `youtube://` GUID, fix the library's metadata settings first
(and "Refresh Metadata" on the library) — the sync cannot match anything
without it.

## 3. Get your Plex token (`YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN`)

Follow Plex's official guide:
[Finding an authentication token / X-Plex-Token](https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/).

Short version: in the Plex web app, open any library item → `⋯` →
*Get Info* → *View XML*, and copy the `X-Plex-Token=...` value from the
opened page's URL.

## 4. Find the library section ID(s)

yarrtube reconciles collections **per kind**: playlist libraries are synced
against your tracked playlists and channel libraries against your tracked
channels, configured with two separate variables:

- `YARRTUBE_PLEX_PLAYLIST_SECTION_ID` — the section id(s) of the Plex
  library or libraries holding your **playlist** downloads
  (`/videos/playlists`).
- `YARRTUBE_PLEX_CHANNEL_SECTION_ID` — the section id(s) of the Plex
  library or libraries holding your **channel** downloads
  (`/videos/channels`).

Each Plex library must hold **one kind only**. yarrtube matches videos to
Plex items by YouTube ID, not by file path, so a single library mixing
playlists and channels can't be told apart: a video that is in both a
playlist and a subscribed channel would leak a stray channel collection into
your playlist library (and vice versa). Point each variable at its own
dedicated library. (Listing the same section id under both variables is
allowed but reintroduces that leak for that library — don't, unless you know
it holds only one kind.)

Find a library's section id in either of two ways:

- **Browser URL**: open the library in the Plex web app and look at the
  address bar — the number after `source=` is the section ID.
- **API**: list all libraries and pick the `key` of the one(s) holding
  yarrtube content:

  ```bash
  curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400/library/sections?X-Plex-Token=<YOUR_TOKEN>"
  ```

  The section ID is each library's `key`. To print just a `title → key`
  table instead of reading the raw JSON, pipe it through `jq`:

  ```bash
  curl -sH "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400/library/sections?X-Plex-Token=<YOUR_TOKEN>" \
    | jq -r '.MediaContainer.Directory[]
             | "\(.key)\t\(.title)\t\(.Location[].path)"'
  ```

  If your yarrtube videos live under a known path, filter to just those
  libraries and print the comma-separated list ready for the env var:

  ```bash
  curl -sH "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400/library/sections?X-Plex-Token=<YOUR_TOKEN>" \
    | jq -r '[.MediaContainer.Directory[]
              | select(any(.Location[]; .path | contains("/yarrtube/")))
              | .key] | join(",")'
  # e.g. prints: 14,19
  ```

Assign each library's section id to the variable for its kind. If content of
one kind is spread across **several Plex libraries** (e.g. one library per
family member), collect every one of them — each variable takes a
comma-separated list, and yarrtube keeps each library's collections in sync
independently: a playlist's/channel's collection is created in whichever
listed library of the matching kind its videos were scanned into. Libraries
*not* listed are never touched.

## 5. Configure yarrtube

Set the environment variables on the yarrtube container and restart it:

```yaml
environment:
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL=http://<YOUR_PLEX_IP>:32400
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN=<YOUR_TOKEN>
  # the playlist library section id(s), and the channel library section
  # id(s); each takes one id or a comma-separated list (e.g. 2,5). Set
  # whichever kinds you use — you can set just one of the two:
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_PLAYLIST_SECTION_ID=<YOUR_PLAYLIST_SECTION_ID>
  - YARRTUBE_PLEX_CHANNEL_SECTION_ID=<YOUR_CHANNEL_SECTION_ID>
  # optional, defaults to 900 (15 minutes):
  # - YARRTUBE_PLEX_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=900
```

The integration is **off unless `YARRTUBE_PLEX_URL`, `YARRTUBE_PLEX_TOKEN`
and at least one of the two section variables are set** — without them
yarrtube behaves exactly as before and never contacts Plex.

On startup the log should show
`scheduled recurring Plex collections reconcile task`; after each pass you
will see `Plex collections reconcile pass succeeded` (or a logged error if
Plex was unreachable — the pass is simply retried on the next interval).

## 6. Recommended library settings in Plex

- **Hide items which are in collections** (the library's Advanced
  settings): this is what turns the library into one tile per
  playlist/channel — videos only appear inside their collection, not
  loose in the grid. Strongly recommended; the integration is built around
  this browsing experience.
- **Don't change a collection's sorting**: yarrtube creates every
  collection with **alphabetical** sorting on purpose — combined with the
  position-prefixed sort titles from the NFO files, that is what keeps
  videos in playlist order. Switching a collection to "Release date" or
  "Custom" breaks the ordering.

## How the sync behaves (what to expect)

- A new video shows up in its collection only after **both** yarrtube has
  downloaded it **and** Plex has scanned it. If it's missing, wait for the
  next scan + sync pass; nothing needs fixing manually. Consider enabling
  Plex's "Scan my library automatically" so new files are picked up quickly.
- A collection is only created once at least one of its videos is scanned —
  you'll never see empty collections.
- Deleting a playlist/channel in yarrtube deletes its Plex collection.
  Deleting a collection by hand in Plex is not permanent: the next sync
  pass recreates it (with its current videos).
- Collections are matched **by name**: the collection's title is the
  playlist/channel name as shown in yarrtube. Renaming a collection in Plex
  will make yarrtube create a fresh one with the original name.
- If Plex is down, yarrtube keeps downloading normally; the sync pass logs
  an error and retries on the next interval.

## Troubleshooting

- **No collections appear at all**: check the startup log for
  `scheduled recurring Plex collections reconcile task` (integration
  enabled?) and for `Plex collections reconcile pass failed` errors (wrong
  URL/token/section id?). Test your values by hand:
  `curl "http://<PLEX>:32400/library/sections/<ID>/all?X-Plex-Token=<TOKEN>"`.
- **A collection is missing videos**: the video isn't downloaded yet, Plex
  hasn't scanned it yet, or its Plex item has no `youtube://` GUID (see the
  verification in step 2).
- **Videos are in the wrong order inside a collection**: the collection's
  sorting was changed away from alphabetical (see step 6), or the items'
  sort titles weren't read from the NFO files.
