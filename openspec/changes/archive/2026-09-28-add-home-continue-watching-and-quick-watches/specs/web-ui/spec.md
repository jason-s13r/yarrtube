## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Home Page Layout
The home view SHALL display up to three sections, in this order: "Continue watching", "Quick watches" and "Latest videos", loaded together in one request. A video SHALL appear in at most one section. "Latest videos" SHALL display up to 18 recently synced videos. "Continue watching" SHALL display up to 6 videos the user has started and not finished recently, and SHALL show on each card how far the video has been watched. "Quick watches" SHALL display up to 6 short unwatched videos. "Continue watching" and "Quick watches" SHALL be hidden when they have no videos, including while their videos are loading or when they cannot be loaded. Each section SHALL display its videos as a grid of cards, each showing the video's thumbnail with its title below it. For videos from a tracked channel, the card SHALL also show the channel's avatar and name.
