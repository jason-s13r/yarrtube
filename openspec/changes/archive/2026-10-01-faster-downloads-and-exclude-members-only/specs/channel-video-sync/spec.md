## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Permanently Failed Video Recovery (Channels)
The system SHALL, for every channel, during each reconcile pass reset any
video that has been permanently errored for at least 24 hours back to
PENDING and trigger a fresh download of it. A video that became
permanently errored less than 24 hours before the pass SHALL be left
permanently errored and SHALL NOT have a download triggered by that pass.
There is no limit on how many times a given video may be recovered this way.
An excluded video SHALL NOT be recovered by this pass regardless of how long
ago it was excluded.

#### Scenario: Permanently errored video found during reconcile
- **WHEN** a reconcile pass finds a video that has been permanently errored for 24 hours or more
- **THEN** the system resets that video to PENDING, clears its recorded filename and quality, and triggers a fresh download of it

#### Scenario: Video permanently errored less than 24 hours ago
- **WHEN** a reconcile pass finds a video that became permanently errored less than 24 hours earlier
- **THEN** the system leaves the video permanently errored and does not trigger a download for it

#### Scenario: Excluded video is never recovered
- **WHEN** a reconcile pass finds an excluded video, however long ago it was excluded
- **THEN** the system leaves the video excluded and does not trigger a download for it
