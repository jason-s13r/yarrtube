# logging Specification

## Purpose

Defines how the daemon reports its own operational activity: at what
severity levels, how that verbosity is controlled at startup, and what
happens to that output in the automated test environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Leveled Log Output
The system SHALL categorize every operational message it emits (startup
checks, background sync/task/event activity, and fatal errors) at one of the
standard severity levels — error, warn, info, or debug — reflecting the
message's actual severity, and SHALL attach the relevant identifying values
(e.g. a playlist or task id) to the message as structured, queryable fields
rather than only interpolating them into free text.

#### Scenario: Routine activity is informational
- **WHEN** the daemon completes a routine operation (e.g. a successful
  startup check, a scheduled sync, a dispatched task)
- **THEN** the message is emitted at info level or below, not warn or error

#### Scenario: Failure is emitted at error level
- **WHEN** an operation fails in a way that prevents it from completing (e.g.
  a startup check fails, a background poll fails, a task or event is marked
  permanently failed)
- **THEN** the message is emitted at error level

#### Scenario: Identifying values are attached as fields
- **WHEN** a log message refers to a specific entity (a playlist, video,
  task, or event id)
- **THEN** that identifier is attached to the message as a named field, not
  only embedded in the message text

### Requirement: Configurable Verbosity at Startup
The system SHALL allow an operator to control which severity levels are
emitted by setting an environment variable when starting the daemon, without
requiring a rebuild, following the prevailing convention for the language
runtime the system is implemented in. The system SHALL emit info level and
above when the environment variable is not set.

#### Scenario: Operator raises verbosity
- **WHEN** the daemon is started with the log-level environment variable set
  to a more verbose level than the default (e.g. debug)
- **THEN** messages at that level and above are emitted

#### Scenario: Operator lowers verbosity
- **WHEN** the daemon is started with the log-level environment variable set
  to a less verbose level than the default (e.g. error only)
- **THEN** only messages at that level and above are emitted, and lower-
  severity messages (e.g. routine info-level activity) are suppressed

#### Scenario: No configuration provided
- **WHEN** the daemon is started without the log-level environment variable
  set
- **THEN** info-level and above messages are emitted, matching today's
  default visible output

### Requirement: No Log Output in Automated Tests
The system SHALL NOT emit log output during automated test runs, so test
output stays limited to test framework reporting (pass/fail, panics,
assertion failures).

#### Scenario: Test suite runs
- **WHEN** the automated test suite executes any test that exercises code
  paths which log
- **THEN** no log lines appear in the test run's output

### Requirement: External Process Diagnostics Reported Through Structured Logs
The system SHALL NOT write the raw diagnostic output (stderr) of the external
download tool (`yt-dlp`) directly to the daemon's log output. When that output
matters for an operation's outcome, the system SHALL report it as part of a
leveled log message carrying the identifying values of the operation (e.g. the
video or channel concerned) as structured fields, consistent with the
"Leveled Log Output" requirement.

#### Scenario: Thumbnail fetch fails with a tool error
- **WHEN** a thumbnail fetch runs and `yt-dlp` exits with an error such as "Video unavailable"
- **THEN** no raw `yt-dlp` stderr line appears in the daemon's log output, and the failure is emitted as one leveled message with the video's id attached as a field and the tool's reason included

#### Scenario: Channel listing fails with a tool error
- **WHEN** listing a tracked channel's videos makes `yt-dlp` exit with an error
- **THEN** no raw `yt-dlp` stderr line appears in the daemon's log output, and the failure is emitted as one leveled message with the channel attached as a field and the tool's reason included

#### Scenario: Tool succeeds
- **WHEN** a thumbnail fetch or channel listing completes successfully
- **THEN** no `yt-dlp` stderr output appears in the daemon's log output

### Requirement: YouTube API Key Never Logged
The system SHALL NOT include the YouTube Data API key in any log output or in
any error recorded for a task, including errors raised when a YouTube API
request fails before receiving a response (for example a DNS, connection or
timeout failure) and errors carrying a YouTube API error response.

#### Scenario: YouTube API request fails to connect
- **WHEN** a YouTube Data API request fails before a response arrives, for example because the host name cannot be resolved
- **THEN** the logged error and the task's recorded error describe the failure without containing the API key

#### Scenario: YouTube API returns an error response
- **WHEN** a YouTube Data API request receives a non-success response
- **THEN** the logged error and the task's recorded error contain the status and response body without containing the API key
