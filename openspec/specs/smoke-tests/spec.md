# smoke-tests Specification

## Purpose

Gives yarrtube an automated, end-to-end smoke suite that proves the real Docker image serves a working webapp — creating playlists/channels, downloading real videos via yt-dlp, and playing them back — runnable both in CI on every change and on demand before/after large refactors.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Dockerized Test Run
The system SHALL provide a script that builds the release Docker image from the repository's `Dockerfile`, runs a container from it with a fresh, isolated database and videos directory, and waits for `GET /status` to return `200` before running any test, failing with a non-zero exit code and the container's logs if readiness is not reached within a bounded timeout.

#### Scenario: Container becomes ready
- **WHEN** the script starts the built image
- **THEN** it polls `GET /status` until it returns `200`, then proceeds to run the test suite

#### Scenario: Container never becomes ready
- **WHEN** `GET /status` does not return `200` within the timeout
- **THEN** the script exits non-zero, prints the container's logs, and does not attempt to run the test suite

### Requirement: Guaranteed Cleanup
The system SHALL remove the container and any temporary database/videos directories it created after the run, whether the run succeeded, failed, or was interrupted.

#### Scenario: Test run fails
- **WHEN** the Playwright suite reports failures
- **THEN** the script still removes the running container and temporary directories before exiting non-zero

### Requirement: Failure Diagnostics
The system SHALL, when the run fails, preserve the container's logs and the Playwright run's traces/videos as files on disk before cleanup, so they can be inspected or uploaded as CI artifacts.

#### Scenario: A Playwright assertion fails
- **WHEN** a test in the suite fails
- **THEN** the failing test's trace and video are retained on disk, and the container's logs up to that point are saved to a file

### Requirement: Playlist Golden Path
The system SHALL verify, through the browser, that adding a `youtube_linked` playlist results in its video being downloaded and playable, and that deleting the playlist removes it from the UI.

#### Scenario: Add playlist, download, play, delete
- **WHEN** a user adds the maintainer-owned "yarrtube-smoke-tests" YouTube playlist through the Add dialog
- **THEN** the playlist appears in the sidebar, a download task appears in the Tasks view, the video's status progresses to Downloaded, the video appears in the playlist detail view and the home feed with a thumbnail and duration, and it plays back in the browser
- **WHEN** the user then deletes the playlist from the sidebar
- **THEN** it no longer appears in the sidebar or the home feed

### Requirement: Channel Golden Path
The system SHALL verify, through the browser, that adding a `youtube_linked` channel results in at least one video being downloaded and playable, without depending on that video's specific identity, and that deleting the channel removes it from the UI.

#### Scenario: Add channel, download, play, delete
- **WHEN** a user adds the `@BlenderOfficial` channel with a video limit of 1 through the Add dialog
- **THEN** the channel appears in the sidebar, at least one of its videos reaches Downloaded status, and that video plays back in the browser
- **WHEN** the user then deletes the channel from the sidebar
- **THEN** it no longer appears in the sidebar or the home feed

### Requirement: Sync Action Coverage
The system SHALL verify that triggering the sidebar "Sync" action on an already-tracked playlist or channel completes without error.

#### Scenario: Sync an existing playlist
- **WHEN** a user clicks the Sync button on a tracked playlist in the sidebar
- **THEN** the action completes without showing an error

### Requirement: Add-Dialog Error Handling Coverage
The system SHALL verify that the Add dialog surfaces a visible error message when creating a playlist with a path already used by another playlist, and when creating a channel with an invalid handle.

#### Scenario: Duplicate playlist path
- **WHEN** a user submits the Add dialog for a playlist whose path is already used by another tracked playlist
- **THEN** the dialog shows an error message and the Advanced options section is expanded

#### Scenario: Invalid channel handle
- **WHEN** a user submits the Add dialog for a channel with a handle that does not resolve to a real channel
- **THEN** the dialog shows an error message

### Requirement: Mobile Sidebar Coverage
The system SHALL verify that, at a narrow (mobile) viewport, the sidebar can be opened via the menu button and closed.

#### Scenario: Open and close the mobile sidebar
- **WHEN** a user viewing the app at a mobile viewport width taps the menu button
- **THEN** the sidebar becomes visible, and tapping its close control or the overlay hides it again

### Requirement: Announcements Bar Coverage
The system SHALL verify, through the browser against the real image, that the announcements bar displays, links, dismisses, and persists correctly. The GitHub announcements URL SHALL be stubbed with a fixed fixture so the test does not depend on the live file.

#### Scenario: Show, follow link target, dismiss, persist
- **WHEN** the announcements URL is stubbed to return `[{"id":"smoke-b","text":"Second [docs](https://example.com/docs)"},{"id":"smoke-a","text":"First"}]` and the user opens `/` in a fresh browser context
- **THEN** a bar shows `Second docs`, where `docs` is a link to `https://example.com/docs` with `target="_blank"`
- **WHEN** the user clicks `Dismiss announcement`
- **THEN** the bar shows `First`
- **WHEN** the user dismisses it and reloads the page
- **THEN** no announcements bar is shown

#### Scenario: Announcements fetch fails
- **WHEN** the announcements URL is stubbed to abort and the user opens `/`
- **THEN** no announcements bar is shown and the header and sidebar render normally

### Requirement: Continuous Integration
The system SHALL run the smoke suite automatically in CI on every pull request and on every push to `main`, using a `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` provided as a repository secret.

#### Scenario: Pull request opened
- **WHEN** a pull request is opened or updated
- **THEN** the smoke-tests workflow runs the dockerized suite and reports its result on the pull request
