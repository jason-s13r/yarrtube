# task-scheduling Specification

## Purpose

Provides a persisted, restart-safe mechanism for scheduling work to run at or after a specific time and executing it through exactly one handler per task, so scheduled and recurring work survives process restarts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scheduling a Task
The system SHALL allow a task to be scheduled with a type, a payload, and a time at or after which it becomes eligible to run.

#### Scenario: Task scheduled for now
- **WHEN** a task is scheduled with a run time at or before the current time
- **THEN** it is immediately eligible to run

#### Scenario: Task scheduled for a future time
- **WHEN** a task is scheduled with a run time in the future
- **THEN** it does not become eligible to run until that time has passed

### Requirement: Single Execution Per Attempt
The system SHALL poll for eligible tasks in the background and dispatch each one to exactly one handler based on its type. When several tasks are eligible in the same poll, the system SHALL dispatch them in ascending order of the time they became eligible to run, breaking ties by the order in which they were scheduled.

#### Scenario: Eligible task is dispatched
- **WHEN** a task's run time has passed and it has not yet succeeded
- **THEN** the system dispatches it to the handler registered for its type

#### Scenario: Earlier-due task runs first regardless of scheduling order
- **WHEN** two tasks are eligible in the same poll and the one scheduled later has an earlier run time
- **THEN** the system dispatches the task with the earlier run time first

#### Scenario: Tasks with the same run time
- **WHEN** two tasks are eligible in the same poll with identical run times
- **THEN** the system dispatches the one that was scheduled first before the other

### Requirement: Retry With Fixed Delay Then Give Up
The system SHALL track a retry counter per task. On failure, the counter SHALL increment and the task SHALL become eligible again after a delay that grows with the number of prior attempts, starting from a configurable base delay, rather than a fixed delay. After 5 failed attempts, the system SHALL log the failure, move the task to the dead-letter table, and remove it from the tasks table so it is not attempted again.

#### Scenario: A task attempt fails
- **WHEN** a task's handler raises an error
- **THEN** the task's retry counter increments and it becomes eligible again after a delay that is longer than the delay used before its previous attempt

#### Scenario: Fifth consecutive failure
- **WHEN** a task's retry counter reaches 5 failed attempts
- **THEN** the system logs the failure, records the task's id, type, payload, final error, attempt count, and timestamps in the dead-letter table, and deletes the task from the tasks table

#### Scenario: Base retry delay not configured
- **WHEN** no base retry delay has been explicitly configured
- **THEN** the system uses its default base retry delay, applied uniformly to every task type

#### Scenario: Base retry delay configured
- **WHEN** a base retry delay has been explicitly configured
- **THEN** the system uses that value, applied uniformly to every task type, in place of the default

### Requirement: Dead-Letter Record for Permanently Failed Tasks
The system SHALL persist a durable record of every task that exhausts its retries, so a permanently failed task remains inspectable after it leaves the tasks table.

#### Scenario: Task moved to dead letter
- **WHEN** a task reaches its 5th failed attempt
- **THEN** a record containing the task's original id, type, payload, final error message, number of attempts, and timestamps is inserted into the dead-letter table

### Requirement: Tasks Table Behaves as a Queue
The system SHALL remove a task from the tasks table as soon as it reaches a terminal state, so the table only ever contains tasks that are pending, scheduled for retry, or currently running.

#### Scenario: Task completes successfully
- **WHEN** a task's handler returns successfully
- **THEN** the task is deleted from the tasks table rather than being retained with a completed status

#### Scenario: Task exhausts retries
- **WHEN** a task reaches its 5th failed attempt, including one recovered from a crash, and is moved to the dead-letter table
- **THEN** it is also deleted from the tasks table

### Requirement: Crash Recovery
The system SHALL, on startup and before resuming normal task execution, treat any task still marked as running from a previous, interrupted process as a failed attempt.

#### Scenario: Daemon restarts with a task stuck running
- **WHEN** the daemon starts and finds a task in a running state left over from a previous run
- **THEN** it increments that task's retry counter and applies the same retry-then-give-up handling as any other failed attempt, before task execution resumes
