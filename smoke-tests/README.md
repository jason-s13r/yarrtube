# Smoke tests

An end-to-end Playwright suite that drives the real Docker image through a
browser: creating a playlist/channel, downloading a real video via yt-dlp,
and playing it back. Run it locally, e.g. before merging or around a large
refactor. It doesn't run in CI: GitHub-hosted runners' shared IPs get
YouTube's "confirm you're not a bot" check, so the workflow is manual-only.

Run it with:

```bash
./scripts/run-smoke-tests.sh
```

from the repository root. It builds the release Docker image, runs it with
a fresh temp database/videos directory, waits for it to become ready, then
runs this Playwright suite against it. The container and temp directories
are always removed afterward; on failure, the container's logs are saved to
`smoke-tests/container.log` and Playwright's traces/videos are kept under
`smoke-tests/test-results/`.

## Fixture prerequisites

These tests hit the real YouTube Data API and download real videos — no
test doubles. That requires:

- **`YOUTUBE_API_KEY`**: a YouTube Data API v3 key. Locally, put it in the
  repository root's `.env` (same as `scripts/run-local.sh` uses). In CI it
  comes from the `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` repository secret (Settings > Secrets
  and variables > Actions > New repository secret) — never printed or
  logged.
- **`SMOKE_PLAYLIST_ID`**: the id of a public, maintainer-owned YouTube
  playlist containing the Creative-Commons "Big Buck Bunny" video. If the
  playlist's contents ever change, the playlist test's download assertions
  may need to change with it.

Optional overrides (defaults shown):

| Env var                      | Default                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `SMOKE_PLAYLIST_ID`           | `PLXWRoRTUXjks` (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXWRoRTUXjks) |
| `SMOKE_PLAYLIST_NAME`         | `test` (the playlist's YouTube title) |
| `SMOKE_CHANNEL_HANDLE`        | `@BlenderOfficial`      |
| `SMOKE_CHANNEL_VIDEO_LIMIT`   | `1`                      |
| `YARRTUBE_PORT`               | `8080`                   |
| `SMOKE_READY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `120`                    |
| `SMOKE_RETRY_BASE_DELAY_SECONDS` | `10`                  |

## What's covered

- **Playlist lifecycle** (`tests/playlist.spec.js`): add the fixture
  playlist via the Add dialog, wait for its video to download, verify it
  shows up (with thumbnail + duration) in the playlist detail view and the
  home feed, play it back, sync it, hit the duplicate-path error, then
  delete it.
- **Channel lifecycle** (`tests/channel.spec.js`): same flow for the
  fixture channel, with loose (non-title) assertions since the channel's
  newest video can change, plus the invalid-handle error case.
- **Mobile sidebar** (`tests/mobile-sidebar.spec.js`): opening/closing the
  sidebar at a narrow viewport.
- **Tasks view** (`tests/tasks.spec.js`): the recurring yt-dlp self-update
  task the daemon seeds at startup is listed as pending.

Together these are also the only coverage of the HTTP API's route wiring
(Rust handler tests call handlers directly, bypassing the router), so every
`/api` route the UI calls should be exercised by at least one spec.

## Local development

```bash
npm --prefix smoke-tests ci
npx --prefix smoke-tests playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

Then, against an already-running yarrtube instance:

```bash
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080 \
  YOUTUBE_API_KEY=... \
  npm --prefix smoke-tests test
```
